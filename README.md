####Format:
>The top-level of this repository is for files that are not part of the Unity project.
>
>The Unity project folder is called Sacrifight_Unity. When opening this project in Unity for the first time, highlight this folder and open the project from there.

####TODO:
>The TODO.md file describes what parts of the project various people are working on.
>
>Commits to **master** that change only the TODO file are completely fine.
>- Items will have three checkboxes before them. These stand for a task being `S` Started, `P` In Progress, or `D` Done.
>- BLOCKED things are BLOCKED by another feature, meaning they cannot proceed until that feature is done.
>- Additionally, each item should include which branch they are being worked on, and any extra notes as needed.
>

####Git Ettiquette: 
>The **master** branch should always work. 
>
>Any features that do not work should not be pushed to **master** until they do.
> 
>When pushing a new feature from your branch to **master**:
>- First pull **master** to your branch
>- Make sure your code still works in the **master** environment
>- Then merge your branch to **master**
>Commit details and names are not necessary on local branch commits, though you may want them for yourself.
>
>Commits (and merges) to **master** should always include some sort of changelog describing what features were added.
  
  
####Code Ettiquette: 
>In the **master** branch, code should preferably be easy to read and documented. 
>
>In other branches, anything goes, but code should be documented before merging with Master.
